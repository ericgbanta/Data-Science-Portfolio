# Eric Banta: Data Science Portfolio
Collection of Data Science Projects

## Regression Projects
### Predicting the Age of Abalone Fish
Used [UCI Machine Learning Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/abalone) to compare the accuracy of different regression models at predicting the age of abalone shellfish. Compared Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression & Random Forest Regression models. For Random Forest - hyperparameter tuning was executed to find the best parameters.
* __Main Tech Used:__ Python, Scikit-Learn, Pandas, Matplotlib, Hyperparameter Tuning
* [GitHub Notebook](https://github.com/ericgbanta/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/Notebooks/Regression/Fish%20Age%20Prediction.ipynb)
* [NBViewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/ericgbanta/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/Notebooks/Regression/Fish%20Age%20Prediction.ipynb)

## Classification Projects
### Predicting Pokemon Battles
Used [Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/terminus7/pokemon-challenge) to build a model that predicts the winner between two pokemon. Utilized basic pre processing techniques, encoding, correlation analysis, feature selection and classification model comparison. After model comparison, implemented a model using Random Forest Classification.
* __Main Tech Used:__ Python, Scikit-Learn, XGBoost, Pandas
* [GitHub Notebook](https://github.com/ericgbanta/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/Notebooks/Classification/Pokemon_Battle_Prediction.ipynb)

## EDA & Visualization
### NBA Player of the Week
Used [Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/jacobbaruch/nba-player-of-the-week) to do some exploratory data analysis on the player of the week award in the NBA. Performed generic data cleansing and data manipulation tasks prior to analyzing data. Utilized dplyr for data manipulation, ggplot2 for data visualization and sqldf to showcase data manipulation skills using sql syntax.
* __Main Tech Used:__ R, Dplyr, Ggplot2, Sql (via sqldf)
* [GitHub Notebook](https://github.com/ericgbanta/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/Notebooks/Exploration%20%26%20Visualization/POTW%20-%20EDA.Rmd)
* [RPubs](https://rpubs.com/ericbanta/nba_potw_eda)

### UFC Fight Location
Used [Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/rajeevw/ufcdata) to perform data visualization on where UFC Fights have happened from 1993 to June 2019. Utilized two libraries to create heatmaps for the location of all UFC Fights and also created heatmaps for a specific UFC fighter with the most fights in this time period. Gmplot and Plotly were the libraries used to create the heatmap visualizations.
* __Main Tech Used:__ Python, Pandas, Numpy, Gmplot, Plotly
* [GitHub Notebook](https://github.com/ericgbanta/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/Notebooks/Exploration%20%26%20Visualization/mma_fight_visualization.ipynb)
* [NBViewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/ericgbanta/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/Notebooks/Exploration%20%26%20Visualization/mma_fight_visualization.ipynb)

### MCU Demographic Survey 2019 Visualization
Sourced data from [r/MarvelStudios 2019 Demographic Survey](https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/doz727/demographic_survey_results_2019/) to perform quick data visualization using Tableau Public. Compiled dashboards and worksheets into a five-page Story to analyze survey results. Key findings include demographic breakdowns, top heroes, top villains, top rated movie and most anticipated movies and characters. This visualization will not be located in this GitHub repo, but will be available to view on Tableau Public.
* __Main Tech Used:__ Tableau Public, Dashboards, Story, Calculated Fields & Filters
* [Tableau Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/profile/eric4224#!/vizhome/MCUDemographicSurvey/MCUSurveyVisualization)

## NLP Projects
### Star Wars Script Analysis
Used Star Wars scripts from the Orignial Trilogy to perform natural language processing and sentiment analysis. Utilized Bag of Words and Sentiment Intensity approach to classify Luke Skywalker lines as positive, neutral or negative.
* __Main Tech Used:__ Python, Pandas, Sklearn.feature_extraction, NLTK
* [GitHub Notebook](https://github.com/ericgbanta/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/Notebooks/NLP/StarWarsNLP.ipynb)
* [NBViewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/ericgbanta/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/dev/Notebooks/NLP/StarWarsNLP.ipynb)
